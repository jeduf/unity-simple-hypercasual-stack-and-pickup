Hypercasual Simple Stack and Pickup Runner Practice
# Features      
Didn't spend too much time on it so beware of the bugs. It's a simple hypercasual runner game with stacking and picking up mechanics to stack objects under the character to get past blocks if the height of the stacked objects are bigger than block's height and to pickup objects on hand to create a path to character when there is a gap between roads. And also a very simple gold mechanic addition. I also used a free skybox from unity asset store so it looks better.
